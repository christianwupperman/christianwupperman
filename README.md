- 👋 Hi, I’m @christianwupperman
- 👀 I’m interested in Crypto, right now using new protocols from various ecosystems such as Harmony One, Avalanche, Fantom, Solana, Arbitrum, etc (No ETH, don't have enough money to spend on gas xD)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about different projects created everyday, trying to flow with the wave or the musical chairs (Riding the OHM + Forks wave right now, also the defi 2.0 and daniele #OccupyDeFi movement from the frogs)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that's not a cashgrab and adds value to the market, I can help via Marketing. I'm a crypto content creator with 2000+ subscribers on Youtube @christianwupperman
